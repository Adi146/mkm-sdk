Installation
============

The installation is really simple. It works like this:

    pip install mkmsdk

You also need to create four environment variables that hold the tokens necessary
to create the authorization for the requests:

* MKM_APP_TOKEN
* MKM_APP_SECRET
* MKM_ACCESS_TOKEN
* MKM_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

Their names are self explanatory.
